HarmonyOS News Client

What is it?
The HarmonyOS news client is a simple news application. Here, 
we want to show developers some common controls and components of the HarmonyOS. In addition, 
we also demonstrate the cross-device migration function. 
You can seamlessly transfer your FA to other devices on the local area network (LAN) to complete news sharing. 
This example code is complete and you can learn from the beginning with us.
