# Distributed Voice Camera

What is it?
In this article, Codelab uses the HarmonyOS distributed file system and AI voice recognition function to develop a distributed voice camera.
Using this camera application, different devices under the same distributed network can see the photos taken by the main device in real time.
This effectively solves the pain point of the need to run back and forth to pass the mobile phone when taking pictures of each other.
In addition, the main device also supports a voice-controlled camera function, allowing you to control the camera from a distance.
